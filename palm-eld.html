        <h1>the three stigmata of palmer eldritch by phillip k. dick</h1>
        <p>On the barren surface of Mars, humans are being drafted from Earth to colonize the planet. Their lives reflected Mar’s lifeless, dry, and dull environment. Not surprisingly, many turned to drugs to escape the harsh reality of existence. Through a psychedelic called Can-D, secretly distributed by cohorts of wealthy business owners and government officials, the colonizers escaped to a shallow fantasy where many indulged in their repressed desires. 
</p>
        <p>In The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Phillip K. Dick comments on corrupt government structures in the 1960s, while simultaneously bringing the reader through the universe’s multiple layers of reality. 
</p>
        <p>When a being who is the spitting image of a missing intergalactic traveler named Palmer Eldirtch arrives with a new psychedelic drug called Chew-Z, Leo Bulero, the leading distributor of Can-D, starts to panic. He fears for his stable grasp over Can-D sales on the Mars colonies. However, as people begin to try the new Chew-Z, many realize that there is something off about the hallucinogenic reality that they enter: it feels a little too real. 
</p>
        <p>Palmer Eldritch, who recently arrived in the Solar System, is really a higher being who gains access to the minds of those who take his Chew-Z. Its users begin to see Palmer’s distinct physical characteristics in the people around them, and they feel a strange change in their being as the high subsides. The characteristics they observe are described as his three stigmata, which consist of a robotic arm, serpentine eyes, and metallic teeth. Just like the stigmata of Jesus, Palmer’s stigmata are representations of the wounds he had previously suffered. </p>
        <p>
            When Palmer inhabits an individual, he feels all that they feel, thinks all that they think, and sees all that they see. Although his presence is often compared to that of a god, there is something almost evil about him and his motivations for seeking self-perpetuation. Unlike God, Palmer is selfish and highly flawed. Unlike God, who cares for humanity, Palmer just happened to stumble upon humanity after years of aimlessly floating through space and saw it as an opportunity for control. 

        </p>
        <p>
            If something so flawed can yield the powers we associate with God, what does that reveal about the nature of our universe and the hierarchy of being? In the dominant Western religions, there is one all-seeing, all-controlling God. In The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, Phillip K. Dick suggests the existence of multiple layers of being. Just as it is argued that human beings have higher states of consciousness than, say, farm animals, what denies the existence of beings of a higher consciousness and power than us? Not just a single, all-pervading, morally just God, but beings with completely different realities, their own versions of reproduction, and potentially the ability to hop in and out of infinite numbers of timelines. 
        </p>
        <p>Although there isn’t any empirical evidence behind the existence of these “higher beings,” the possibility of it prompts the reflection of what it means to be human, and what consciousness truly is—this idea of multiple layers of being echoes Gnosticism. In the centuries that followed the death of Christ, various sections of Christianity emerged, all of which offered their own take on the principles of the religion. As time passed, many scholars argue that orthodox Christianity was the result of a kind of survival of the fittest, where all the strongest ideas converged into one religion that became the most widely accepted. 
</p>
        <p>Gnosticism, however, offers a radically different viewpoint than the one that dominates Christianity today. Gnosticism suggests that the material world in which we live is an imperfect creation of a deity called Ialdabaoth, who was born when God’s divine emanation of wisdom attempted to reproduce. Although our physical bodies are a reflection of the imperfection of Ialdabaoth, there is something in our existence, in our consciousness, that connects us to the incomprehensible and all-seeing God that was the origin of Ialdabaoth. 
</p>
        <p>Just as the colonists on Mars were trapped in their illusions of a material world, only temporarily enlightened to higher states of consciousness by Palmer’s Chew-Z, what if we are trapped in that same illusion, utterly unaware of all that exists beyond our own physical reality? Although Palmer Eldritch didn’t create humanity–he was just a lonely being traveling through space and time–he reflects Ialdabaoth in that he is a flawed being that isn’t God himself, but a lesser emanation of it.
