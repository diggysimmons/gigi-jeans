        <h1>Restaurant</h1>
        <p>I won’t tell you how I know what a chicken is or how I am able to communicate with you at all because that doesn’t matter. So don’t question me. I am telling my story in terms that only you can understand, and you only. Every other shade of being either can’t comprehend my message or can’t sense its presence, just like how your eyes can’t see the atoms that construct the world around you. It doesn’t matter what your things are made of, as long as they’re there. It doesn’t matter why two plus two is four or why the derivative of sine is cosine, as long as they’re there. If you question me, just as you would the laws of the universe, all hell will break loose: you’ll forget who you are and why you think. 
        </p>
        <p>And there we were: waiting for the table we reserved at the finest restaurant around. A pool of brownish ooze leaked out of our clumpy extremities, staining the floor with yet another permanent glob. It was essential to mark the restaurant with our smell and presence, even if it would inevitably be covered up: the different clans’ territorial marks piled on top of each other like competing dog piss at the local fire hydrant. 
        </p>
        <p>The smell filled the waiting room like hot breath, but the hostess, who’s been working here as long as I can remember, looked unfazed. With my eyes, I trace the drips of ooze that trail off in every direction toward the restaurant’s interior. Each winding path, created by those slimy beasts’ leakage, led to a grand dining table, where each clan congregated for their evening’s delights. The creatures resembled human burn victims who had been cooked at their skin’s exact melting point, and toasted, just a little, on the surface for good measure. Any remnants of facial features, or any features at all, were invisible amid the sagging and wet skin of these monsters. In the restaurant’s damp lighting, our silhouettes looked like mounds of shit, with obscure traces of arms and legs swallowed up by melted fat. 
        </p>
        <p>The flaps of my father’s skin vibrate as drops of fluid escape his body’s crevices, indicating that he is dissatisfied with me in some way. “Stand straight,” he buzzed, “people are looking.” If there were one thing we disagreed on, it would be how I presented myself to others. I knew better than to talk back to him: after years of trying to communicate my discontent, I realized his stubbornness was an incurable disease. The bacteria of his ego fester and feed on every glimmer of my hope. Every one of my rebellious actions, right or wrong, only validates his belief that only he could be right. There is nothing I can possibly do, now or ever. I am condemned to a life of imprisonment, prosecuted by my own father, unable to escape the cell of his presence even in his absence. By the time he passes, I will have forgotten my youthful passions, and I will turn into what I spend my days resenting: just like him. This is a truth that I have come to accept, just as he and many before have as well. 
        </p>
        <p>I feel discomfort in my stomach area, so I look down and notice my intestines, in anticipation of the feast to come, already begin to dangle. Out of embarrassment, I quickly shove them back into my stomach and look around to make sure no one else noticed. Then, I wonder why I even care what they think. I feel a greater sense of embarrassment towards my species than my body’s agenda. I cringe at the sight of my father's clumpy hands and the toxins that leak out of his unnecessarily large pores; I shudder at my mother’s dirty smell, which persists even after the hours she spends cleaning herself; I gag at the hostess’s feet, whose countless sores have escaped the molding hands of evolution. What baffles me is that nobody seems to notice: the power of familiarity never fails to amaze me. I can’t help but think that, despite our superiority, God frowns upon us. That he made us so disgusting because history’s creatures had failed him time and time again. Life here is purely asymmetrical… 
        </p>
        <p>“Your table is now armed and ready for service,” the hostess quietly screams. As an aggressive race, war terminology wriggled its way into our daily speech. I snap out of it; however, it takes me a second to adjust. As she led us to our table, she bothered us with the expected small talk. The sounds that came out of her mouth seemed foreign, and I comprehended her words as if my consciousness perceived speech not as sounds, but shapes. But as we walked into the main dining hall, my discomfort dissipated with the smell of food. I forgot about everything and entered this trance, where all that mattered was my instincts. It feels like the only thing that calms me nowadays are sleep, food, and success.
        </p>
        <p>My focus shifts to the restaurant’s decorations. Every color that filled its interior was a remarkably distinct shade of purple. Not a single outline meshed together. The color of the tables differed from the color of the floor, like black on white. It was like looking at a purple rainbow, where each shade flowed beyond the brim of every possible frequency, both visible and invisible. The color of the grandfather clock was as close to brown as rust, but it was purple. As the pendulum swung, it moved so quickly that traces of movement were visible to my eyes. The purple pendulum left a purple aura. 
        </p>
        <p>Before I knew it, we reached the table. I look towards my father, and judging by the look on his face, something was off. I didn’t know why until I realized there were four, instead of five, floor-to-ceiling windows behind our table; that each chandelier hung three, instead of four, feet above each chair; and the placemats were a shade of purple approximately 17 microhertz less than they usually were. We were seated at the table immediately behind our usual one. Never, in all the time we have been dining at this restaurant, has our table changed. By chance and by habit, we had always been seated at the exact same table. Surprisingly, he only shrugged and sat down. After he took his seat, everyone else followed, secretly relieved that he had said nothing. 
        </p>
        <p>Today was a special day. My mother’s friends were joining us for dinner. They were a distinct-looking bunch of creatures, not because of their features, which looked almost identical to everyone else’s, but because of their hats. My father, mother, grandmother, grandfather, older brother, younger brother, older sister, twin sister, great uncle, minor aunt, almost everybody I knew, and I lived naked. These ladies, however, seemed to have a hat for every occasion. Their hats were so unique and obscure that just looking at them made me question my existence. Every sharp angle and dull edge tested the boundaries of my perception, creating shapes I never knew existed and would never be able to remember if I were asked to recall them. My mother’s favorite friend flaunted an ancient iceberg whose land was inhabited by snakes. It was arranged in a way you could see both the inside and outside of the iceberg, and both the guts and the scales of each slithery snake at once. Their teeth were industrial white, and instead of fangs, they were hexagons with a pattern that made them look 3D printed. What a show-off. 
        </p>
        <p>It took only hours for our food to arrive. While waiting, we sat in complete silence: what else was there to talk about except food? I spent most of the time trying to understand her hat, and right as I was about to wrap my head around it, the food arrived. Unfortunately, I will never know what song the shepherd’s goat was playing from the inside out of his cave. What did I expect? She is the most pretentious of my mother’s friends, constantly ingraining the most impossible riddles into her hats’ designs. 
        </p>
        <p>In unison, all of our plates gracefully crash onto our hungry placemats. Plates full of maggots. In unison, all of our intestines abruptly jut out of our stomachs. It was an uncontrollable biological response. Our stomachs simply didn’t have enough room to contain the pulsing and writhing movements of our intestines. It was as if they had minds of their own, constantly pushing and pulling back and forth, side to side. Unlike all of my other bodily functions, my intestines were free from my mind’s dictation. Everything else, I simultaneously controlled: my heart’s beating, my vision, my breathing. As an infant, it took me longer than the rest to combine the images both of my eyes received. At the center, my vision was a swirly mess of light beams, where every object I saw seemed to blend together. However, I eventually came around.</p>
        <p> Next to all of our chairs was a coat rack where we quickly hung our intestines, as if they were an accessory unattached to our own bodies. Then, without hesitation, we all pounced on our meals in our own distinct ways. With her left hand, my mother desperately holds her stomach tight; with her right, she aggressively throws handfuls of her dish into her mouth, tossing more food to the side than down her gullet. Repeatedly sinking and compressing his body down towards the seat of his chair, my father abruptly springs upwards and folds over onto his plate. Each time he does this, he only takes a small bite. His method particularly puzzles me as it seems extremely energy inefficient. 
        </p>
        <p>Almost immediately after the first drop of worm had catapulted down our stomachs, the pumping began. By the way our intestines digested, it looked as if they hadn’t caught even a whiff of food for eternities. It was such a desperate sight; I didn’t know it was possible for an unaware organ to display so much greed and longing. After we had finished, the previously pearly white tablecloth no longer shone its iridescent glow. And the table’s guests sat back in victory; victory over the table, but also victory over death. My race ran out of things to triumph over, so they made it customary to starve themselves and then eat a great feast inches away from death. 
        </p>
        <p>Satisfied, my mom’s iceberg friend cracks a joke with her deep and distorted voice, which sounded unlike any man or woman. 
        </p>
        <p>“I could feel death herself clinging to my feet as I took those first, sweet bites.” 
        </p>
        <p>Everyone burst out into uncontrollable laughter. I did not find it funny at all; I feared death would one day retaliate. When the time comes and we are unable to win our last battle, our fate is ultimately up to her. And death is a debt that must always be paid. I thought more of my existence as a generosity, not a battle that I must win. This is one of the many things that differentiated me from them. 
        </p>
        <p>When the infernal laughing reached its peak, the clock struck a skin scrawling sound. It sounded exactly like a chicken. The sound echoed through my body and scratched every surface of my insides with its paws; I felt it most aggressively in my intestines.
