        <h1>ethics of ambiguity by simone de beauvoir</h1>
        <p>“Man makes himself a lack of being in order that there might be being.” – Jean-Paul Sartre.
        </p>
        <p>At first glance, this quote looks like a sentence of randomly generated words with no particular meaning. However, after much contemplation and much lack of understanding, I have finally personally drawn meaning from it. Sartre argues in Being and Nothingness that man is defined by what he is not—hence, the “lack of being.” From this lack of being, humans are given the ability to strive towards “being;” however, this goal of complete “being” is ultimately impossible. We are not fixed, and we are not complete for the entirety of our personal existence. This lack, although a burden, gives us freedom: it grants us the space to define ourselves in the absence of predetermined meaning.</p>

        <p>This quote is a central part of Simone de Beauvoir’s argument for ethics in absurdist philosophy. At first, it may seem that the absence of inherent meaning leaves us with total freedom to do absolutely anything. However, Simone de Beauvoir argues quite the opposite. Just as with great power, with great freedom comes great responsibility—a responsibility to uphold not only ourselves but also the world we are constantly creating.
        </p>
        <p>To explore this further, we must define what Simone considers the true meaning of freedom. Freedom is something that we, as humans, are born with. But for this freedom to truly exist, Simone insists we must both acknowledge it and will it into being. Anything that truly exists must affirm its own existence: “I think, therefore I am.” Freedom, then, is not about doing whatever we want whenever we want; it is about having both the responsibility and the ability to create passion, values, and meaning in an absurd world. With the freedom to make decisions, we naturally create values to guide and shape those decisions. To live a purposeful life, we must sustain these values. If we abandon them—if we let them crumble into the past—we waste not only our freedom but also its very purpose. If you don’t carry out your values, what is the point of them existing at all?
        </p>
        <p>What gives life meaning is not only living in the present but also transcending it by working towards a passionate project. The values that our freedom creates, in turn, create authentic goals or projects. These goals are deeply subjective and are merely a representation of your values: they give you the opportunity to express and validate your values in the external world. Although these individual goals can be accomplished, the values that drive your life must never be; they must live and grow alongside you. 
        </p>
        <p>This leads into a deeper paradox. Say your value is to live a completely moral life. However, morality can only exist if immorality exists as well. The entire goal of ethics is to strive toward morality. However, this proves to be an unreachable aim, because achieving total morality would require the abolition of immorality. Good can only exist in contrast with bad. This absolute contradiction defines human life: an unending journey to reconcile two opposing ends. We cannot strive for good unless bad exists. Yet what makes life so difficult is that it’s impossible to fully reach that goodness. Still, if your goal is to make the world a completely “good” place, that is a valid goal—even if it is technically unachievable. 
        </p>
        <p>Recognizing freedom in yourself also means recognizing freedom in others. Something cannot exist without the ability to affirm itself and realize its own being. But when someone misinterprets the true meaning of freedom, they often fall into immoral behavior. This is what Simone refers to as “the serious.” It’s the mindset of someone who latches onto ready-made values, like a child, someone who strives to reach a supposed “end” that will validate all their efforts. But life is not about completion; it is about continuation.
        </p>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, projects and ambitions sprout from a continued value. When you discard a value from your past, it loses its meaning in life. The progression of life is the progression of the self towards goals, created by your values. When you remember something with content, passion, and love, it doesn’t cease to exist; its value remains in your soul and mind. Your past experiences, if framed and accepted correctly, should accumulate into the values you uphold in life.
        </p>
        <p>Life, in this way, reflects Camus’ metaphor in The Myth of Sisyphus, where each human is condemned to roll a stone up a mountain for the rest of their existence. We are condemned to uphold values that will never fully reach an end. Returning to my earlier point on morality, humans are caught between two opposing ends that can never truly coincide—because each only exists in relation to the other.
        </p>
        <p>Even when you fulfill a project that was driven by your values, your freedom opens new directions to pursue, so you can continue to uphold and re-express those same values. But when you're unlucky enough to be completely drained of the opportunity to exercise your freedom, there always exists suicide: the last motion of freedom. That said, passion toward exercising true freedom is only one kind of passion. There are also passions rooted in external values. Simone describes “the serious” as someone who passively accepts external values and allows those values to dictate their life. This is reminiscent of childhood, when the world’s values are imposed upon us.
        </p>
        <p>The goal of man is to rise above that passivity: to exercise his freedom, to decide for himself, and to establish values that are not inherited from society but born from within. Another form of the “serious” is the person who accepts a project and, upon completing it, forever dwells in its memory. Take, for example, someone who runs a business in their youth. If the success of that business becomes their whole identity, then what happens when their body or mind can no longer support it as it once did? They had not been living in freedom, but in submission to that external structure. Their decisions weren’t driven by self-made values, but by allegiance to something outside themselves. However, if that business was founded upon values they personally upheld, then the loss of it wouldn’t erase their freedom. They would still have the capacity to live by their values—even if through different means. If the painter is robbed of his canvas, he will find other ways to realize his artistic creativity. If the philosopher loses his paper and pen, he will still spend his days in contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>Yet this is not the full expression of freedom. That mindset—that a single expression of a value is its completion—contradicts the nature of life, where true ends can never be met. Values are not meant to be “completed”; they are meant to be carried out. Absurdism does not excuse selfish freedom, where every action is defensible because of the universe’s objective nature; it implies a human responsibility to create subjective meaning, separate from outside influence. The personal values that every human being must acquire should be created selflessly: they should be created for creation’s sake, not for control or external validation. If that is the case, your goals should not interfere with the freedoms of others. In the end, meaning is not something that we find; it is something that we develop. Although the truth that our lives cannot reach some total and overarching completion is distressing, it is the truth that we must accept and transcend.
