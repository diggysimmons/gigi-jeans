        <h1>the fire next time by james baldwin</h1>
        <p>Through a vivid account of his relationship with prostitution, religion, and those around him, Baldwin describes the limited paths of life available to black people in America. Although Baldwin’s personal experience is unique, his attitude toward his restriction and “the man” describes the overall condition in which black Americans were living at the time. Upon reaching the age of 14, Baldwin struggled with what exactly he wanted to do with his life. Unfortunately, as a black teenager, his options were limited, and every one of them involved submission to white authority. He was condemned by society’s generational belief that black people had a specific “place” in society.
        </p>
        <p>Baldwin one day decided that he would turn to the Church. The Church offered him protection, and it offered him an escape from the burden of being a black man in America. In that period of time, he belonged to the Church; he described himself as being its “little boy,” and he enjoyed the relief that came from belonging to something. However, amid the passionate and lively sermons he gave, Baldwin eventually realized the flaws in Christianity and his own reliance on it. This personal realization is what connects his experience to the overall issue of black oppression in the United States. He realized that the paths offered to black Americans lacked pure love and freedom; even if the church offered a temporary freedom from–or ignorance of–white domination, that freedom wasn’t true. The church, which praised love and faith, was not only corrupted within its organization, but the very power of Christianity stemmed from control over land and control over people. 
        </p>
        <p>Although the rise of Islam offered a new, separate path for black Americans free from white influence, its ideology was still rooted in control. Baldwin saw the same distance from love in the Nation of Islam as he saw in the Christian Church. While Baldwin didn’t blame the Nation of Islam’s followers for believing what they believed–if anything, he thought their beliefs to be instinctual–he criticized the movement for its lack of perspective and its historical base. The NOI defended their radical stance through a fabricated history, claiming that white people were created by evil scientists and were thus inherently evil. For Baldwin, this delusional mythmaking was only empowering in the short term and would eventually lead to deeper disillusionment. The path towards equality, he argues, lies in accepting one’s true history and using it as a source of strength and belonging.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, one of NOI’s main goals was to gain the power that white people once had in America, the same power that had previously caused them to suffer. Instead of working towards a better future, one driven by love, the Nation of Islam fought hate with hate. With this outlook, the NOI wasn’t influencing any growth in the human race; they were only making the same mistakes their white counterparts were.
        </p>
        <p>Although Baldwin rejected the NOI’s push for separation, he also criticized the idea that Black people should integrate into white society on white terms. He dismantles the American dream and the idea that it represents freedom. In 1963 and today, American freedom is rooted in materialism and control(a very single-minded viewpoint). While this type of false freedom gives the illusion of security and success, it stems from a fear of mortality and an inability to control death. For Baldwin, the antidote to this obsession with control is love: while control seeks dominance and superiority, love symbolizes selflessness and the recognition of others’ freedom. Instead of latching onto these external notions of success, which white Americans often did, Baldwin argues that the true path to love is accepting the burden of freedom and creating your own values. Many black Americans found themselves and their passions because they recognized the impossibility of true control and then freed themselves from it. This is exemplified by the extremely emotional and innovative art that black people were releasing in the 60s and 70s. And despite their oppression, they pitied the white Americans who caused their suffering because they realized they were suffering in their own constricting ways as well.
        </p>
        <p>So, in response to the prevailing idea of black integration, Baldwin writes, “Do I really want to be integrated into a burning house?” Baldwin was interested in not becoming equal with white people, but having white and black people become equal with each other. He was interested in setting a higher standard for the human race–one in which every individual strives for moral growth. He believed that within the hearts and minds of people lies something more free and more loving. For America to succeed, we must not only focus on technological and economic advancement but also prioritize social, cultural, and spiritual development. And to succeed as individuals, we must move with love, the opposite of power, and disregard our animalistic instincts to be superior to others.
