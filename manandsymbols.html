        <h1>man and his symbols by carl jung</h1>
        <p>It is estimated that only 5% of human brain function is conscious, while the remaining 95% works beyond our awareness and control in the unconscious. Although we rarely notice it, the unconscious mind is active throughout our lives – dictating organ function or enabling us to perform routine tasks naturally. However, when we are asleep and our conscious mind is at rest, our unconscious mind continues to work and process all our thoughts, feelings, emotions, and so on. This inner processing often manifests in dreams and visions.</p>

        <p>Carl Jung is a highly controversial figure in the field of psychology. He blends psychology with spirituality, often drawing on ancient Eastern religions to support his arguments, challenging the strictly rational and empirical reasoning in modern psychology. Although modern science has enabled humanity to advance at a rapid pace, Jung argues that people become lost in these new inventions and the constant abundance they bring. We begin to discard intuition in favor of logical reasoning, and we start to overlook the more spiritual aspects of ourselves because they are deemed irrational. In doing so, we become separated from our deeper, human purpose, leading to lives that feel mechanical and devoid of meaning. 
        </p>

        <p>In Man and His Symbols, Carl Jung introduces the concept of the “collective unconscious,” where the experiences of our ancestors reside within the depths of our minds. Jung argues that this collective unconscious holds archetypes and symbolic memories that influence our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, even if we are unaware of their origins. One example that he uses is the dreams of a young girl. A patient of his received a dream journal from his daughter, which contained undeniable religious symbolism, mainly relating to the origins of Christianity, that she had never been exposed to. Although her parents were protestant by name and familial roots, they didn’t have a deep connection to the religion. Jung suggests that the girl’s dreams’ symbolic imagery stems from a deep connection to her ancestry that had revealed itself through her unconscious. 
        </p>

        <p>In modern science, research in epigenetics suggests that intense emotional experiences, such as trauma, can lead to changes in gene expression and that these changes may be passed down to future generations. This leads to a conclusion similar to Carl Jung’s theory of the collective unconscious, where deeply embedded experiences are passed down and shape the psyche on a fundamental level. Humans’ most basic instincts, dating back tens of thousands of years, still exist within our minds and dictate the decisions we make and the emotions we feel today. For example, when you purchase something you don’t need in search of material abundance, that urge might be connected to your primal instinct to seek security, status, or survival—deeply rooted drives that have been shaped by collective human experience over generations. While epigenetics and Jung’s theory are in different domains, they both suggest that human ancestry has an influence on modern behavior. 
        </p>

        <p>Another important concept within Man and His Symbols is the process of individuation, in which the conscious and unconscious minds unite and become aware of each other. Jung argues that when one becomes fully aware of unconscious thoughts and motivations, one becomes their true self. Rather than following external influences and attempting to shape your personality according to social trends, you must understand both your inner and outer self.
        </p>

        <p>One point of contact with the unconscious mind is through dreams. Jung states that dreams play a vital role in this process of individuation, as they can make you aware of your life’s deficiencies. When you consciously ignore unconscious drives in a refusal to accept certain parts of yourself, it creates a drift within your mind. For instance, one of Jung’s patients was a thrill-seeker: he was addicted to hiking dangerous mountains, constantly attempting to transcend himself. However, he complained of having a recurring dream in which he saw himself stepping off a tall mountain into a gaping abyss. Jung warned him, saying his dream might be a sign from his mind, warning him of the dangers of his current lifestyle. Six months later, his dream was realized: he fell off a mountain, undermined by his own actions and beliefs. His unconscious mind was aware of the dangers that his conscious mind was oblivious to, or at least didn’t want to accept. The unconscious mind holds multitudes of information that your conscious mind is unable to comprehend all at once. Therefore, it is able to create connections we might not see ourselves. Through symbols and intuition, the unconscious mind reveals underlying truths. Jung argues that a refusal to accept these truths leads to psychological imbalance. 
        </p>

        <p>Paying attention to motivations beyond what you consciously acknowledge can help you uncover parts of yourself you’ve never previously noticed. Whether it’s something you want to hear or not, listening to your subconscious mind will pull you down to reality. If you find yourself feeling hopeless and unable to understand why you're experiencing certain emotions, meditation or dream analysis may illuminate hidden patterns or offer some helpful guidance. However, I am not suggesting that you should blindly follow your unconscious mind, as it is ultimately up to you to decide what brings you the greatest happiness. Your unconscious mind is not perfect or all-knowing, but when approached thoughtfully, it can become a tool for self-realization and growth.
