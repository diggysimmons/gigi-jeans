        <h1>Hermit Crabs</h1>
        <p>He has a rash, one that he should’ve been checked out weeks ago. It just appeared one day for no obvious reason. He was sitting at his desk, filing his papers, when suddenly, he noticed it. A smear of small skin-colored bumps, like the stroke of a paintbrush, lay right in the center of his left hand. It was a mild but ugly sight. It was one of those things whose presence seemed like a fluke, a glitch in the matrix. He did not doubt that it would be done with in a few days’ time. For now, he would cover his hand with a band-aid so that the customers wouldn’t see it. But business was slow this time of year, so he didn’t have much to worry about anyway. Even then, it's not like he would face much judgment: the people here were covered in all sorts of sores, all caused by a range of indecent sources. 
        </p>
        <p>“Mama, look! They have hermit crabs.” He is a chubby little boy. His weight spills out of his pants in a relentless battle with the fabric that refuses to stretch. His stomach is full and happy, while his heartbeat already begins to fade. 
        </p>
        <p>“Yes, baby, I see that.” She knew what he was about to ask, and because she was tired of him and his constant pleading, she gave in before he even attempted. She scratches her ass. The tattoo she got a few days ago on the boardwalk is beginning to get infected.
        </p>
        <p>“How much?” She said. 
        </p>
        <p>
            “The Hermits are free with the purchase of a cage, miss.”
        </p>
        <p>“How much?” She said.
        </p>
        <p>“10.99” 
        </p>
        <p>Her face didn’t move an inch during this interaction. She heard the price, and without hesitation, unzipped her dirty black fanny pack. Out came her last ten-dollar bill, with the shopkeeper’s eyes following it like a hawk. If you looked closely enough, you could see his eyes begin to bulge out of his head and his pupils begin to dilate. From the money, his insultingly immodest eyes then traced her lumpy body, looking for perfection. However, no perfection was to be found on this completely imperfect Sunday morning.
        </p>
        <p>“Uh, and 99 cents, miss.” He reassured, scratching at his rash. 
        </p>
        <p>“Yeah, hold on… hold on, just give me a minute, Jesus.” She said aggressively, but she had to pick her battles. She would rather be annoyed by this lowly shopkeeper than by her son if he didn’t get what he wanted. She handed him one more dollar, making sure not to touch him. 
        </p>
        <p>“Keep the change.”
        </p>
        <p>He bowed to her in thanks. </p>
        <p>“Now, which crab would you like, little boy? We have superheroes, super models, and super children themed crabs, little boy. ”
        </p>
        <p>“That one.” Said the boy while pointing at the crab whose shell was painted with the Batman symbol. It was clinging onto the side of the cage, longing for the days it had been free. Stacked on top of it were at least 50 other crabs who were doing exactly the same. It was hard to tell which ones were dead or alive. 
        </p>
        <p>The man picked up his blue scooper and began to push the crab onto the floor of the cage. It pulled its claws into a tight ball as its last attempt to defend itself against the wrath of the shopkeeper. As
