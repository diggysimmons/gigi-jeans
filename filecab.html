        <h1>Filing Cabinet</h1>
        <p>It was a filing closet you’d often get lost in. And its alphabetical order was unlike any alphabet I have ever seen. However, no matter how many times I reached a dead end or wandered past the areas I was familiar with, I always found my way back to the window. The window. A great, big floor-to-ceiling pane, resembling that of a modern mansion, except the view wasn’t a vast sea or a hanging cliff, but a bank-like room. 
        </p>
        <p>At the moment I appeared in this universe, the great vibrating string just happened to be twinging at the most painful frequency, causing my whole existence to echo that same, unlucky vibration. But there is nothing I can do: the box was just my stroke of bad luck. And inside it was where I lived. My home, or where I merely stand, is surrounded by windows and three gray, emotionless, and bare walls. At the top, my prison slowly fades out into complete nothingness — not black, but the complete opposite. It was a colorless void, and it was the unknown constantly hanging above my head. On my most desperate days, I longed to float up into the darkness and leave all of what I knew behind. However, because I am physically incapable, when I feel like escaping, I wander through the endless and very mysterious filing cabinet. 
        </p>
        <p>Right between the two grey and uncomfortable couches that sit opposite the window, a greyer and more uncomfortable-looking door stands. The door is the only object that holds its ground amidst the pervasive mystery that has defined my life. But behind it lies the biggest mystery of all. In this room, infinity and all of its relatives coexist. The unimaginable and the supremely complex predict each other in equations only understood by me. The room's walls extend like the Earth’s horizon, its end invisible no matter how far you wander. The only thing about the room that made tangible sense was its endless rows of filing cabinets. I felt a…
        </p>
        <p>Every day, customers enter, lugging thick packets that I often never have the energy to read. Through thin pockets on the bottom of the window, the packets slide over the floor and slip into my room. Behind the window, onlookers can admire the squalor in which I live; onlookers can be grateful they aren’t trapped in an exposing box as comfortless as mine.
        </p>
        <p>I never envied them, though. If anything, I feared those crusty old creatures. And I feared the day one would eventually find a way in. Not that there was much to do in here. From the grainy, tiled floors to the industrial walls, my abode was the spitting image of a hospital waiting room. 
        </p>
        <p>“Brrrring!” the door hollered. 
        </p>
        <p>A suspicious-looking man with peeling skin walked in. A large, black top hat clumsily hid his insecurities. The lighting cast a shadow on his face, one that looked out of place in this unbelievably bright room. He had a slow, creeping walk; he walked with no haste, with intention. 
        </p>
        <p>The envelope he carried was filled to the brim with a lumpy substance, and it made a clinking noise when he walked. All sorts of strange people enter through that door, but this man struck a new chord. Something about his appearance didn’t make sense to me–not one part of his body or clothing fit with the other. Maybe it was just my eyes playing tricks, but the color of his arms didn’t match the color of his legs or the color of his face. But the transition from body part to body part was so seamless, it was as if I was seeing five colors at once. Like a ball rolling on a frictionless surface, he continued to glide my way.
        </p>
        <p>Once he reached the window, he stopped, looked straight at me, then gracefully slid the envelope through the slot in one motion. As he walked away, the crispy sounds of his every step sounded in unison with the beats of my heart. Boom…boom…boom…boom. As those two noises echoed through the room, I couldn’t help but feel as if it were a countdown. It was hard to have any sense of space or time in here. But now, I was waiting for something to change; now, I had hope that this phase of my life would eventually come to an end. 
        </p>
        <p>Usually, the envelopes consist of stories from a different time. They range from boring to absolutely thrilling, disgusting to heartwrenching, and so on. Some stories are like repetitions of others, other stories are so unthinkably unique they can’t be compared with any. But all of the stories have absolutely nothing to do with me. I receive them, sometimes read them, then put them in the closet. 
        </p>
        <p>From his hands, the packet slides and stops, almost intentionally, right before my feet. As he walks away, a particular aroma escapes his body. Then, a particular cloud swoops in and fogs up my thoughts. All I can think to do is look up and watch him leave. The door swings wide open with one effortless pull, and that familiar darkness beyond the doors swallows him up. Now, all that was left of him was the ghost of his presence. I need to go to sleep…
        </p>
        <p>The dusty covers of his pull-out bed welcome him with the overwhelmingly strong force of fatigue. 
            He lost his marbles
